## Food

Neil (left) and Finn (right) eat twice daily; once in the morning and once in the afternoon/evening.

Their food is individually packaged into containers for each meal which are stored in the fridge.

Neil eats the food in 1 small container for each meal and Finn eats the food in 1 large container for each meal.

Please put their food in ther food dish prior to feeding and then place the container in the sink (rinse it if you would like).

Neil eats out of the small, stainless steel bowl and Finn eats out of the purple, maze dish.

*Important*: I make Finn sit and wait to be given the command "Eat!" before he eats.

## Walks

Neil and Finn typically get 1 walk per day. On weekends they walk and play fetch.

If you decide to walk Neil and Finn, please try to give them an hour or 2 for their food to properly digest if walking them after eating.

Their leashes are on the table in the kitchen.

Neil always walks on the right and Finn always walks on the left.

We typically walk to [Foothills Elementary School](https://foothills.jordandistrict.org/) and back.
